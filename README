skeem was a scheme implementation in C which I started working on in 2012, but
never completed due to real life. I uploaded the code on github to prevent it
from being lost, if I ever wanted to restart work on it.

HERE BE DRAGONS.
The code here is ugly and incomplete (and horrendously over-engineered). It was
something I wrote the time I was learning C. You have been warned.
